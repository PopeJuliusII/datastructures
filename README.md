# Data Structures

### Testing

Run the test.zsh file to test the data structures.

### Trie

I'm a big fan of tries and am hoping to implement them soon in a project I'm working on. My implementation here is a pretty standard one using nested dictionaries. I also added counting functionality.

##### Test: Trie

The test runs on "How A Gardner May Get Rid Of Doormice", one of my favourite, if not my favourite, chapter from the [The Count of Monte Cristo](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184).
